# Reflux_Diagnosis_WashU

## General Info

The goal of this project is to quantify how often gasteroenterologists agree or disagree on reflux diagnoses. Nineteen patients with an esophageal monitor had their reflux episodes recorded over a two-day timespan. The monitor is able to detect changes in pH and thereby show the reader precisely where both acidic and non-acidic reflux occurred over the time period. These recordings were read by five different reviewers; at which time, the reviewer made their diagnoses. In addition to these five reviewers, there is an autoscan program which highlights sections of the pH impedance tracing that would indicate reflux. 

The major obstacles of this project were 1) bringing all ninety-five files into the same dataset and 2) labeling them based on how close their timestamp was to the timestamp just before it. In the notebook you will find the functions which made this task possible. Additionally, both the patient and physician information has been de-identified for privacy purposes.
